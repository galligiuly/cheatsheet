# Download from SFTP and upload to BigQuery table - Cheatsheet



This cheatsheet comes from the need that in my work I could download automatically from SFTP service the daily transactions of a payment gateway on csv format and upload it on a pre-created BigQuery table.



Programming language: **Python**



Since the documentation for this specific purpuse is quite scattered, I've decided to summary all the needed cheatsheet for differents cases:



- Download one csv from one SFTP

- Download one csv from differents SFTP

- Connection and upload to a BigQuery table of one csv
